# ShipLOAD-Minigames
This Unity Project contains two minigames that did not make it into the final product of ShipLOAD. A game created in my team production class.     Cloud Data is a DDR- Style game using ASWD keys as the input buttons.  ​  Heat gauge is a game of preventing the gauge from filling up otherwise it will destroy them.
